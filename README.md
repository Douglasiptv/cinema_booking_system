## Notes for Beginners / Known Limitations
- In **seat creation** (Admin), the CSS is only designed for **5 columns per row**. You can define more rows and columns in the backend, but on the frontend, each row displays as 5 columns. For example, if you define 10 columns in one row, R1 will display as 2 rows.  
- Make sure your project folder includes a folder named `uploads/`. Otherwise, the pictures you upload for movie posters or profile pictures will **not be displayed**.  
- As a student developer, I welcome constructive feedback and questions! üòÑ
